        <p>Sunita Lyn "Suni" Williams (née Pandya; born September 19, 1965) is an American astronaut and a retired U.S. Navy officer. 
            Williams served aboard the International Space Station as a participant in Expedition 14, a flight engineer for Expedition 15 and Expedition 32, and commander of Expedition 33. 
            A member of NASA’s Commercial Crew program, she became the first woman to fly on a flight test of an orbital spacecraft during the 2024 Boeing Crew Flight Test and had her stay extended by technical problems aboard the ISS for more than nine months. 
            She is one of the most experienced spacewalkers in the world: her nine spacewalks are second-most by a woman, and her total spacewalk time of 62 hours and 6 minutes is fourth overall and the most by a woman.
        Williams was born in Euclid, Ohio, but considers Needham, Massachusetts, to be her hometown.[1] 
        Her father, Deepak Pandya, was an Indian-American neuroanatomist from Mehsana district, Gujarat, while her mother, Ursuline Bonnie Pandya (née Zalokar) was a Slovene American.
        Her parents resided in Falmouth, Massachusetts. She is the youngest of three children. Her brother, Jay Thomas, is four years older and her sister, Dina Annad, is three years older. 
        Williams' paternal family is from Jhulasan in India[2] whereas her maternal family is of Slovene descent.[3] 
        Williams has taken the Slovenian flag,[4] a samosa and Carniolan sausage to space in celebration of her Indian and Slovenian heritage.[5] 
        Her nicknames are Suni in the United States[1] and Sončka in Slovenia.[6]
        Williams graduated from Needham High School in 1983.
        She received a Bachelor of Science degree in physical science from the United States Naval Academy in 1987, and a Master of Science degree in engineering management from Florida Institute of Technology in 1995.
